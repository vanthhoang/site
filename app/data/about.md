### Intro
I am currently a software engineer in the health care industry with knowledge ranging from claim perspective to application data. I have worked on various projects involving web development, logging and monitoring, data extraction, data visualization, and data analytics. I have worked with the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, and Node) stack to build out a server and connect with the UI. I also have worked with technologies and tools like Splunk, ElasticSearch, Kibana, Openshift, and Jenkins. I am interested in opportunities to do front-end and full-stack development.
